# VrscFiatTracker

A programme to convert the Verus Staking Rewards with the underlying fiat exchange rate on that day. The tx export file of the Verus Desktop wallet is used for this and the API of CoinGecko is used to get the exchange rate. As the free API from CoinGecko is used, a delay is set in the config file.
